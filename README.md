# pebble-flipped-bits

The "Just a Bit" demo watchface from Pebble --- except with the bits flipped
so they read correctly, MSB to LSB.

[![Preview Image](https://raw.github.com/cscott/pebble-flipped-bits/master/preview.png)](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=4111&aName=cscott&pageTitle=Just+a+%28flipped%29+bit&auID=4559)

This is actually a BCD-format watch.  The digits read hours to seconds,
top-to-bottom.  It updates every second.

Modifications released into the public domain by C. Scott Ananian, 2013.

The license for the rest of the code is whatever Pebble chose for their
"Just a Bit" demo.
